For your guidance, bank has provided you the following eligibility criteria for car loans.

| Requirements               | Salaried Individuals | Business Persons |

###### Table: Eligibility Criteria for Car Loan
###### Task 1:

You are required to write an application program which will facilitate user to check eligibility
based on the upper table. If the user is not eligible, the application will prompt user “You are
not eligible for this loan” and this step should be repeated to check other customer’s eligibility
criteria.

###### Task 2:
In other case if the user is eligible, your developed application should provide an interface which
will ask the following information to calculate monthly installment as per plan.
* Car name
* Total Cost of Vehicle (In Rupees)
* Down payment (20-50%)
* Number of Years (3,4,5)
* Markup Rate (taken from customer 10 - 15%)

###### How to do?

* If a person is eligible remaining process will be carried out.
* Followings are the parameters taken from the customer:-
    * Car name
    * Total Cost of Vehicle
    * Down payment
    * Number of Years
    * Markup Rate Option

**Note: -** Followings are checks on different fields
